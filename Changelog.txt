Version 1.0:
First Version That I kept

Built For minecraft 1.13.1(18w30b), completely compatable with 1.13

-Every mob has their own path with a different block depending on their type, and players have paths too.
	e.g.
	Zombie has a Brown Concrete Path
	Skeleton has a Bone Block Path
	Players have a Blue Concrete Path
	etc.
	Discover Every Type for Yourself!
-Every mob/player can create a path in the air by just walking to it, Not togglable
-Ground mobs have paths on the ground, Flying/Water mobs have trails underneath them
-Paths are only created under players if they are in survival or adventure mode, any other mode won't!
-Every block that is a path and their respective items are tagged under the #mobpaths:ispathtype tags respectively
That's it!

Changelog for MobPathPack Betas:

Version 1.2 Beta 2:
-This version changes the code so that the path is created from 3x3 square centered about the player
-the diff variable is not used in this beta
-a new variable called lagspiked is created, it measures lagspikes, but only when the player is moving, and not that well
-The new player path is not just when the pathonair toggle is on, but also when it is off
-The new path, unfortunately, does not fix the bug - the painful bug
-You could say this Update so far is a failure. :(

Version 1.2 Beta 1:
-This version rewrites the path code to prevent the player from falling off when walking
-To do that, a new variable is calculated named diff(after difference). It is the related to the difference between positions of the tick and the tick before
-With that, the current system uses local coords to draw place the blocks in a specific way to prevent the player from falling off, but it feels very buggy and bad and it is very exploitable. 
	The code, once again, will be rewritten. But I did feel that this code should be kept, so here it is!
-Also, upon load, the pack states the pack version :)


Nice To Know Facts:
-It took a day for me to come create version 1.0
-Betas weren't started until v1.2
